Because VM1 is our Gateway it needs two network adapters one that is NAT and the other that is just internal. \r\n\r\nMake sure you have a ssh server running on them. If you didn't do this on install, then run:\r\n<pre>sudo apt-get install openssh-server\r\n</pre>\r\nBecause we've gone with NAT, we'll have to setup port forwarding under networking and then ssh to localhost using the port you specified.
